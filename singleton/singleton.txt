A Singleton pattern in python is a design pattern that
allows you to define a class from which just one instance can be created,
throughout the lifetime of a program.

Singleton creates an instance only if there is no instance created so far
otherwise, it will return the instance that is already created. 

Singleton is a creational design pattern that
focuses on how to create an object from a class.


Using a singleton pattern has many benefits. A few of them are:

To limit concurrent access to a shared resource.
To create a global point of access for a resource.
To create just one instance of a class, throughout the lifetime of a program.


Summary:

Singleton pattern is a design pattern in Python
that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
It can limit concurrent access to a shared resource,
and also it helps to create a global point of access for a resource.
